# Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: USER Role Badge Visibility Problem

**Problem**: In `/dashboard/admin/results`, the USER role labels had white text on white background, making them invisible.

**Root Cause**: The USER role badge was using `variant="outline"` which gave it a white background with light text.

**Solution**: 
- Changed USER role badge variant from "outline" to "destructive" 
- Added custom className for USER role: `bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 border-blue-300`
- This gives USER badges a light blue background with dark blue text, making them clearly visible

**File Modified**: `app/dashboard/admin/results/results-client.tsx`

```tsx
// Before:
<Badge variant={user.role === 'ADMIN' ? 'default' : user.role === 'TEACHER' ? 'secondary' : 'outline'}>

// After:
<Badge
  variant={user.role === 'ADMIN' ? 'default' : user.role === 'TEACHER' ? 'secondary' : 'destructive'}
  className={
    user.role === 'USER' 
      ? 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 border-blue-300' 
      : ''
  }
>
```

## Issue 2: Submit Modal Not Closing After Exam Completion

**Problem**: After finishing an exam and submitting, the "Submitting Your Exam" modal remained open instead of closing and redirecting.

**Root Cause**: The modal state `isSubmit` was not being reset to `false` before navigation, and the navigation timing was causing issues.

**Solution**:
- Explicitly set `setIsSubmit(false)` to close the modal before navigation
- Increased timeout from 500ms to 1000ms to ensure UI updates complete
- Used direct `window.location.href` navigation as requested (avoiding Next.js router complications)
- Applied the fix to both empty submission and regular submission flows

**File Modified**: `global/use-exam-handler.ts`

```typescript
// Applied to both submission paths:
setTimeout(() => {
  setMode(null);
  setIsSubmit(false); // Close the modal
  window.location.href = '/'; // Direct navigation that works
}, 1000);
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Dev server starts without errors  
- ✅ USER role badges now visible with blue background and dark text
- ✅ Submit modal properly closes after 1 second and redirects to home page
- ✅ Both empty submissions and regular submissions work correctly

## Notes
- Used `window.location.href` as specifically requested by user
- Increased timeout to 1000ms to ensure modal animation completes before redirect
- USER role badges now have consistent styling with other elements in the blue color scheme
