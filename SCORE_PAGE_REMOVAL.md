# Score Page Removal - Complete Cleanup

## What Was Deleted

✅ **Completely removed all score page functionality as requested**

### Directories Deleted:

- `app/(root)/score/` - Entire score page directory and all subdirectories
- `components/score/` - All score-related components and subdirectories

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `global/use-exam-handler.ts`

**Reverted redirect back to home page:**

```typescript
// BEFORE (score page redirect):
window.location.href = `/score/${selectedAssessment.id}`;

// AFTER (home page redirect):
window.location.href = '/'; // Redirect to home page
```

#### 2. `app/assessments/[assessmentId]/page.tsx`

**Removed score page redirect for completed assessments:**

```typescript
// BEFORE:
redirect(`/score/${params.assessmentId}`);

// AFTER:
redirect('/');
```

#### 3. `components/common/text-editor/element-render/index.tsx`

**Removed score component import and result mode rendering:**

- Removed `import ResultBlankRender from '@/components/score/...'`
- Removed `props.mode === 'result'` cases that used ResultBlankRender
- Kept only 'edit' and 'readonly' modes

#### 4. `config/routes/auth-routes.ts`

**Removed score route from public routes:**

```typescript
// BEFORE:
'/score/:assessmentId',

// AFTER:
// (removed completely)
```

## Current Behavior

- ✅ After exam submission → redirects to home page (`/`)
- ✅ No score page exists anymore
- ✅ All score-related components removed
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ USER badge visibility fix still intact

## Summary

The entire score page functionality has been completely removed as requested. Users will now be redirected to the home page after completing their assessments, and there are no remaining references to the score page in the codebase.
