# Submission Logic Revert Summary

## What Was Reverted

I reverted ONLY the submission handling changes in `global/use-exam-handler.ts` back to the original working version.

## Changes Reverted:

### 1. Writing Assessment Submission

**Reverted from:**

```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  setMode(null);
  setIsSubmit(false); // Close the modal
  window.location.href = '/'; // Direct navigation that works
}, 1000);
```

**Back to:**

```typescript
setMode(null);
window.location.href = '/'; // Use window.location for immediate navigation
```

### 2. Empty Answers Handling

**Removed the entire empty answers handling block:**

- Removed the `if (userAnswers.length === 0)` special case
- Removed the zero-score submission logic
- Let it fall through to normal processing (which handles empty arrays fine)

### 3. Regular Assessment Submission

**Reverted from:**

```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  setMode(null);
  setIsSubmit(false); // Close the modal
  window.location.href = '/'; // Direct navigation that works
}, 1000);
```

**Back to:**

```typescript
setMode(null);
window.location.href = '/'; // Use window.location for immediate navigation
```

## What Was NOT Changed

- ✅ USER role badge visibility fix remains intact
- ✅ Error boundary improvements remain intact
- ✅ All other functionality untouched

## Result

- Submission logic is back to the original working state
- No timeouts, no manual modal closing
- Direct immediate navigation as it was before
- Empty submissions will be handled by the original logic
- USER badges are still visible (blue background with dark text)

The submission should now work exactly as it did before my changes, while keeping the visible USER badge fix.
