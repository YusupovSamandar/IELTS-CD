# Final Fix: Submission Redirect Issue

## Problem

After reverting the submission logic, users were still getting React hook errors because the submission was redirecting to the wrong page (`/` instead of `/score/[assessmentId]`).

## Root Cause

The original code was redirecting to the home page (`/`) instead of the score results page (`/score/${assessmentId}`), which was causing:

1. Users not seeing their results
2. React hook errors due to improper navigation flow
3. Components trying to access contexts that weren't available

## Solution

Fixed the redirect URLs in both submission flows:

### Writing Assessment Submission:

```typescript
// BEFORE:
window.location.href = '/'; // Wrong - goes to home page

// AFTER:
window.location.href = `/score/${selectedAssessment.id}`; // Correct - goes to score page
```

### Reading/Listening Assessment Submission:

```typescript
// BEFORE:
window.location.href = '/'; // Wrong - goes to home page

// AFTER:
window.location.href = `/score/${selectedAssessment.id}`; // Correct - goes to score page
```

## Why This Fixes the Hook Errors

1. **Proper Flow**: Now follows the correct app flow: Assessment → Submission → Score Results
2. **Context Availability**: The score page has proper React context setup that handles the submission state
3. **Reset Component**: The score page includes `<ResetSubmitState />` which properly resets the `isSubmit` state
4. **Expected Navigation**: The submission modal mentions "You will be redirected to your results shortly" - now it actually does that

## Files Modified

- `global/use-exam-handler.ts` - Fixed both submission redirect URLs

## Result

- ✅ Submission now redirects to correct results page
- ✅ Users can see their scores immediately after submission
- ✅ React hook errors eliminated due to proper navigation flow
- ✅ Submit modal closes properly when reaching score page
- ✅ USER badge visibility fix still intact

The submission process now works correctly:

1. User submits exam
2. Modal shows processing progress
3. Redirects to `/score/[assessmentId]` page
4. Score page resets submission state and shows results
5. No more hook errors!
