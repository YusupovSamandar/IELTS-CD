1. Letter Answer question group is working incorrectly. If i insert A,B,C,D,E,F as options i also see G as an option too. WTF. find out why and fix it.
2. Question group can also consist of 1 question only. currently if i create a question group from lets say 40 to 40 then i got an error saying that latter must be greater. 
in this situation i want it to create 1 question number 40.
