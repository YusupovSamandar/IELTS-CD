1. One letter answer is not working correctly. i have selected all the correct answers from select but in results table it is showing that only 1 is correct out of 4. i see the problem, the problem is that all answers to questions are stored in question table and there the answer is 'A' by default but the way it is implemented is that the letterAnswer table stores the answers. it is wrong. the response should be stored in the question table correctAnswer column. change that. make sure to delete the correct answer from the letterAnswer table cause it is not needed. just like in completion type the completion table only stores the information, and the question table stores the answer to the completion, i want the same thing implemented, when submitting since the results are being compared to quesiton.correctAnswer the answer must be stored in the question table for letterAnswer.

2. COMPLETELY REMOVE THE respond from the questions table. the answers must not be saved in the database of any user. delete all the function pages anything related to respond of the question table. 

3. remove 'yes no not given from listening only', it should not show this question group in listening, it is for reading only.

4. make listening audio upload dynamic. In dev mode when i upload an audio it is stored in the public folder meaning that in production i have to restart to get the audio. i dont want that, currently when i upload an audio in production with npm run start, it is stored in public folder and i cant access the file and cant play right away after uploading it, since public folder is for static files. Fix that. Also same for writing i think, i havent checked yet but if it is storing the images in public the same issue will happen most likely so make it dynamic as well.
